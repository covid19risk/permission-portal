## Covid Watch Permission Portal is a web app by non-profit Covid Watch to complement our Covid-19 exposure notification mobile app.

Permission Portal is to be used by an agent who has the authority to verify a positive Covid-19 test result (to prevent false positives).

- User of this can be a public health official, testing lab, organizational head/hr person
- Ability to verify a test result so that a user can notify others of potential exposure
- Ability to customize the user app experience for the community by setting phone numbers, testing center info, etc

You can see how our mobile app and permission portal work together in the quick [5 minute demo video on our website](https://youtu.be/vgT0Cysh7m4).  See [our website](https://www.covidwatch.org/) for more general information about our organization and goals.
