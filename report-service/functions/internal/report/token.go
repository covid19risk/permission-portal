// On the design of the upload token (see [1] for more details):
//
// When un-verified reports are uploaded, they are first placed in the database
// in a pending state. An "upload token" is generated and displayed to the user.
// The user conveys this token to the contact tracer (over the phone, email,
// etc), and once the contact tracer has verified the user's diagnosis, they
// enter the token into their web portal, marking the report as verified.
//
// We have the following design goals for the token:
// - Each token must be unique.
// - Tokens must be as short as possible in their encoded form to aid in
//   usability.
// - It should be unlikely for a token to be verified by accident. There are
//   two ways that this can happen: a human error can result in an
//   incorrect-but-valid token from being input, or an expired token can be
//   re-allocated, and a contact tracer can verify a user using the old, expired
//   token.
//
// Given these goals, we design tokens with the following properties:
// - In order to allow tokens to be encoded using as few characters as possible,
//   they are allocated as close to 0 as possible.
// - In order to accomodate non-native speakers, for whom letters can be
//   difficult to pronounce, tokens are encoded in octal.
// - In order to minimize the likelihood that an incorrectly-input token will
//   be a different but still valid token, we add a 9-bit random key to each
//   token; this key must match in order for two tokens to be considered equal.
//   Note that this also minimizes the likelihood of accidental verification
//   due to an expired token being used since it's unlikely that the same token
//   will be allocated with the same key.
// - Since tokens are variable-length, without modification, it would be
//   ambiguous when somebody is done speaking a token out loud. In order to
//   eliminate ambiguity, we suffix each encoded token with the digit 9, which
//   is not a valid octal character, and so can only appear at the end of the
//   token.
