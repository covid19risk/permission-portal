// Concerned Citizen,
// We know what you're asking yourself: "Did these brain dead Covid Watch devs just check their API keys in to
// an open source repository?". The answer is of course, yes we did. But don't worry, these are not "API keys"
// in the normal sense of the word. They should rather be thought of as configuration URLs that tell our app
// which Firebase infrastructure it should talk to. Firebase handles security in other ways, see the following
